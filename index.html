  <h3>Returning</h3>
After the one good poem<br>
came the many bad ones.<br>
<br>
It was time to return home,<br>
back to the old ways of living.<br>
<br>
I lay on the terminal floor,<br>
raincoat crushed beneath my head,<br>
<br>  
awaiting departure.<br>
By dawn I would be on my way,<br>
<br>
asleep I hoped against the window<br>
only dreaming of all that passed.<br>
<br>
Blur of corn, stoic silos<br>
green shadows in the forest<br>
<br>
a young man who strode and<br>
stretched across a prairie waving<br>
<br>
and much later a lone firework<br>
exploded raining its red light down<br>
<br>
revealing what had been<br>
hidden for so long for an instant.<br>

<h3>What's Wrong?</h3>
<body style="background-color:#B0E0E6">
The day begins without you<br />
<br>
with wet hair bursting into the cafe.<br />
<br>
Waiters balancing dirty plates<br />
<br>
turn the other way.<br />
<br>
Your friends meaning well<br />
<br>
have messed up totally.<br /> 
<br>
Instead of a party they gave you<br />
<br>
twin boys hugging your ankles<br />
<br>
calling you Three.<br />
<br>
Magnetic dust<br />
<br>
coats your thoughts.<br />
<br> 
Men and animals<br /> 
<br>
come off the mountain<br />
<br>
and pitch tents<br /> 
<br>
in the waning light.<br />
<br>
Tomorrow they expect<br /> 
<br>
to make their presentation<br />
<br>
and tonight you've barely<br />
<br>
touched your eggs.<br />
<br>

<h3>Face</h3>
We each have someone<br> 
secret to think about.<br> 
<br> 
It’s snowing enough to count.<br> 
<br> 
I’m looking in the window<br> 
and I don’t like what I see.<br> 
<br> 
If you stop me, I won’t<br> 
explain it well, I’ll claw<br> 
at my face, you hate that.<br> 
<br>

<h3>Lake of Islands</h3>
Currants are funny<br>
little fruits he said<br>
<br>
with only his whole house<br>
to lean on<br>
<br>
grass fanning out<br>
undiscerning<br>
<br>
popping the sun<br>
on a string.<br>
<br>
Upstairs in the new place<br>
she was morning sick<br>
<br>
with all her friends<br>
tied her in knots<br>
<br>
and later at the picnic<br>
she gave birth to them again<br>
<br>
on a blanket spread<br>
under the trees all<br>
<br>
fussy like lovers<br>
in a hammock.<br>
<br>
Within that spring<br>
there slept a dreadful summer.<br>
<br>
The lake swallowed the path<br>
so we turned back.<br>
