Hi everyone,<br>
Because I suddenly have a lot of free time, and April is poetry month, I will be sending out one new poem via email every day in April.<br> 
<br>
You can enter your email in the form above at any time to start receiving poems.<br>
<br>
For every person that subscribes, I will donate $1 to the Greater Chicago Food Depository to help those in need during the pandemic.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to it,<br>
J.G.

Hi everyone,<br>
It has been nice catching up with a lot of old friends who asked for a copy of "American French."<br>
There are still a few floating around, so let me know if you want one.<br> 
And if I said I'd give you a copy in person, I have one for you.<br>
<br>  
I feel motivated to keep writing, so I hope to have more to share soon. <br>
In the meantime, here is a poem from AF that is at least partially about writing. <br>
Thanks, <br>
J.G. <br>

<h3>The Roast of Mr. Right</h3>
<body style="background-color:#99DED8">
You seem<br />
nonplussed<br> 
and I'm sorry<br>
<br>
I've never had any input,<br>
and yet here we are.<br>
<br>
Yesterday for instance,<br>
I stopped in the street<br>
to look at a snowflake<br>
I swore I recognized.<br>
<br>
I couldn't explain what I felt then,<br>
much less shut up about it.<br>

<h3>What's Wrong?</h3>
<body style="background-color:#FFFF00">
The day begins without you<br />
<br>
with wet hair bursting into the cafe.<br />
<br>
Waiters balancing dirty plates<br />
<br>
turn the other way.<br />
<br>
Your friends meaning well<br />
<br>
have messed up totally.<br /> 
<br>
Instead of a party they gave you<br />
<br>
twin boys hugging your ankles<br />
<br>
calling you Three.<br />
<br>
Magnetic dust<br />
<br>
coats your thoughts.<br />
<br> 
Men and animals<br /> 
<br>
come off the mountain<br />
<br>
and pitch tents<br /> 
<br>
in the waning light.<br />
<br>
Tomorrow they expect<br /> 
<br>
to make their presentation<br />
<br>
and tonight you've barely<br />
<br>
touched your eggs.<br />
<br>

<h3>Face</h3>
We each have someone<br> 
secret to think about.<br> 
<br> 
It’s snowing enough to count.<br> 
<br> 
I’m looking in the window<br> 
and I don’t like what I see.<br> 
<br> 
If you stop me, I won’t<br> 
explain it well, I’ll claw<br> 
at my face, you hate that.<br> 
<br> 
<hr size="5"; hr color="3F77A5">
<h3>Lake of Islands</h3>
Currants are funny<br>
little fruits he said<br>
<br>
with only his whole house<br>
to lean on<br>
<br>
grass fanning out<br>
undiscerning<br>
<br>
popping the sun<br>
on a string.<br>
<br>
Upstairs in the new place<br>
she was morning sick<br>
<br>
with all her friends<br>
tied her in knots<br>
<br>
and later at the picnic<br>
she gave birth to them again<br>
<br>
on a blanket spread<br>
under the trees all<br>
<br>
fussy like lovers<br>
in a hammock.<br>
<br>
Within that spring<br>
there slept a dreadful summer.<br>
<br>
The lake swallowed the path<br>
so we turned back.<br>
