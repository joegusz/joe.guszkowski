<font color="EF6B6B"; font size=5><strong>It was the first Sunday of Lent</font color></strong> and the first anniversary of the death of my Polish grandmother, and it felt right to go find some paczkis. The city had been suffering through a cold and snowy stretch, but that morning it was inching into the merciful mid-30s, so I set out for a place called Sweet World Pastry about 3 miles from my apartment.
  <br>

<br>
For the first few years of my life, my grandma lived upstairs from us. I wouldn’t say we were ever particularly close, and as she got older it became more difficult to communicate with her. I wasn’t around as much, and I didn’t put in a good effort. At her funeral a year earlier, everyone agreed that she had lived a good, long life that was tantamount to saintly.

Chicago still had that sleepy Sunday morning feeling when I started my journey. I listened to Fran Spielman grill the streets and sanitation commissioner about snow removal on her podcast. There was so much snow they were running out of places to put it, and he wouldn’t say exactly where they were putting it, for fear of kids catching wind and creating mischief on the massive piles. 
<br>
    <br>
I walked past the vacant Sears building at Six Corners and Fantasy Costumes with its walls of gaping masks and the abandoned adult video store. A bar was advertising a deal on Corona and pizza in a desperate stab at normalcy. I crossed the bridge over the Kennedy and passed under a dark Germanic overpass and came upon a man shoveling a path through the knee-high snow on the sidewalk. 
<br>

<br>
    <br>
My grandmother had a certain mildness that I now recognize as part of my heritage. She loved butterflies. When she visited my dad at his frat house in the ’60s, the desecration made her cry. I remember her raising her voice only once: She was babysitting me and for some reason I started pulling handfuls of grass out of the lawn. “Don’t be pulling up the grass,” she said. The words are burned into my memory due to their extraordinary nature. 
<br>
    <br>
<font color="EF6B6B"; font size=3><strong>*</font color></strong>
<br>
    <br>
As I approached the man, he was chopping at a patch of ice with the sharp edge of his shovel. The way was too narrow to pass, and since he hadn’t seemed to see me, I said, “Excuse me.” He turned and looked at me as if he’d just bitten into an apple and found a worm. “You gotta be fuckin’ kidding me,” he said. Then he gestured with his shovel toward the street, separated from us by a deep snowbank. “Step the fuck off.”
<br>
    <br>
After months of little to no spontaneous human interaction, being told to fuck off was kind of exhilarating. But I didn’t want to walk into the street, so I went around on the other side, filling my boots with snow. Had I been out of line? Should I have doubled back and crossed the street? Some other people were shoveling further down the sidewalk and they allowed me to pass without incident.  
<br>
    <br>
I moved onward up Milwaukee, past a long line of salt-streaked cars at the carwash, the 16th District Police Station, Polish medical clinics, FOREMOST LIQUORS, The Ham Tree Inn, all of it drab and utilitarian under the stainless steel sky. People were coming out of Walgreens and walking dogs and going about their day, just another day on the anonymous outskirts of an American metropolis.
<br>
    <br>
And then I got to Sweet World Pastry, and it was closed. 
<br>
    <br>
I peered through the window into the dim little shop, cramped with displays, a small round table and a curved glass bakery case that was all but empty. As my dad would say: Curses!
<br>
    <br>
<font color="EF6B6B"; font size=3><strong>*</font color></strong>
<br>
    <br>
On the wall in my grandma’s old apartment there was an enormous, lighted painting of Jesus Christ. She used to sit underneath it in her recliner, her khaki-colored sneakers not quite touching the ground, knotting rosaries out of light blue string for some kind of volunteer effort. She signed all of her cards “Love and prayers, Grandma.”
<br>
    <br>
<font color="EF6B6B"; font size=3><strong>*</font color></strong>
<br>
    <br>
As I turned around to start the 3-mile trek back home, empty-handed, a tall man materialized on the sidewalk seemingly out of nowhere. He was walking quickly and balancing a large metal tray on his shoulder—a tray lined with five perfect rows of golden-brown, sugar-dusted packzis. 
<br>
    <br>
I was stunned. “Where are you going with those?” I blurted out. He looked bewildered and picked up his industrious pace, an oblivious angel in a navy blue work coat. He was headed toward the grocery store next to Sweet World, a place called Andy’s Deli.   
<br>
    <br>
I followed him inside and was greeted by a familiar smell, the steamy, salty smell of Christmas Eve at my Uncle Gary’s house: kielbasa. I trailed the paczki man down a narrow aisle and emerged in front of a vast and crowded meat counter, patrolled by several older ladies in blue aprons and paper hats. On the wall behind them hung sausage links of all shapes and sizes. It was like I’d died and gone to Polish heaven.
<br>
    <br>

<br>
    <br>
Every Christmas Eve, before kielbasa, the family would assemble around the dinner table and pass around a brittle, rectangular wafer called an oplatki. Each of us would snap off a piece and say a few words about something we were thankful for. Grandma usually opened with something along the lines of “I’m just glad I’m still here”—her way of letting loose after a
couple Brandy Alexanders. Then she would pray for all of us, her children and their children, and though I am still uncertain about the realness of God or prayer, I felt at the very least connected, like a branch in a network of branches, radiating from this quiet woman who was its reason for being. 
<br>

<br>
    <br>
Inside the busy deli, I hung back while the guy loaded the paczkis into a plastic bakery case. According to Wikipedia, paczkis have been made in Poland since the Middle Ages. The idea was to use up all the good stuff in the pantry before 40 days of Lenten austerity. They are allegedly made with a dash of vodka to keep the dough from absorbing the oil. I had never even had one before.
<br>
    <br>
<font color="EF6B6B"; font size=3><strong>*</font color></strong> 
<br>
    <br>
It was counterintuitive, but the older and more frail my grandma got, the more she would light up like a much younger person when you’d lean in to give her a peck on the cheek.
<br>
    <br>
<font color="EF6B6B"; font size=3><strong>*</font color></strong>
<br>
    <br>
I packed a dozen paczkis into two cardboard boxes and made my way through the tidy little store to the checkout. The lady in front of me was buying a Polish newspaper and some pink weenies in a plastic bag. I paid for the paczkis and went outside. The boxes were surprisingly heavy. I headed home with my burden of sugar and fat, this time on the other side of the street.

  <h3>Returning</h3>
After the one good poem<br>
came the many bad ones.<br>
<br>
It was time to return home,<br>
back to the old ways of living.<br>
<br>
I lay on the terminal floor,<br>
raincoat crushed beneath my head,<br>
<br>  
awaiting departure.<br>
By dawn I would be on my way,<br>
<br>
asleep I hoped against the window<br>
only dreaming of all that passed.<br>
<br>
Blur of corn, stoic silos<br>
green shadows in the forest<br>
<br>
a young man who strode and<br>
stretched across a prairie waving<br>
<br>
and much later a lone firework<br>
exploded raining its red light down<br>
<br>
revealing what had been<br>
hidden for so long for an instant.<br>

<h3>What's Wrong?</h3>
<body style="background-color:#B0E0E6">
The day begins without you<br />
<br>
with wet hair bursting into the cafe.<br />
<br>
Waiters balancing dirty plates<br />
<br>
turn the other way.<br />
<br>
Your friends meaning well<br />
<br>
have messed up totally.<br /> 
<br>
Instead of a party they gave you<br />
<br>
twin boys hugging your ankles<br />
<br>
calling you Three.<br />
<br>
Magnetic dust<br />
<br>
coats your thoughts.<br />
<br> 
Men and animals<br /> 
<br>
come off the mountain<br />
<br>
and pitch tents<br /> 
<br>
in the waning light.<br />
<br>
Tomorrow they expect<br /> 
<br>
to make their presentation<br />
<br>
and tonight you've barely<br />
<br>
touched your eggs.<br />
<br>
<br>
<h3>Face</h3>
We each have someone<br> 
secret to think about.<br> 
<br> 
It’s snowing enough to count.<br> 
<br> 
I’m looking in the window<br> 
and I don’t like what I see.<br> 
<br> 
If you stop me, I won’t<br> 
explain it well, I’ll claw<br> 
at my face, you hate that.<br> 
<br> 
<br>
<h3>Lake of Islands</h3>
Currants are funny<br>
little fruits he said<br>
<br>
with only his whole house<br>
to lean on<br>
<br>
grass fanning out<br>
undiscerning<br>
<br>
popping the sun<br>
on a string.<br>
<br>
Upstairs in the new place<br>
she was morning sick<br>
<br>
with all her friends<br>
tied her in knots<br>
<br>
and later at the picnic<br>
she gave birth to them again<br>
<br>
on a blanket spread<br>
under the trees all<br>
<br>
fussy like lovers<br>
in a hammock.<br>
<br>
Within that spring<br>
there slept a dreadful summer.<br>
<br>
The lake swallowed the path<br>
so we turned back.<br>
